# README

## What can this solver do?

In its current state ***nothing***. But there are many plans to extend the functionality in the future. Maybe a second version may be made for more general particles.

## What is planned for the future?

- Include particles (electrons, protons, neutrons)
- Include obstacles (fragile, solid)
- Include holes
- Include repulsion
- Include strong force/nuclear force("stickiness")

## Technical details `TODO` list

- Magic bits
- Hashing
- Some way to reverse link boards
